My teammates and I made this project was made at the University of Waterloo hackathon using React, Redux, and Firebase in a timespan of 24 hours. 
A common goal that we wanted to acheive in this hackathon was to improve public safety. We would often times ignore the overfilled garbage cans in cities, drive past the broken traffic lights, almost slip on the unsalted sidewalk in the winter, leaving the danger situation for the person behind us. Agencies need to be informed of such issues as soon as possible, and the public needs to be movitated to keep our city safe and clean. Our website, allows the users to fill our a form, and provide proof of incident via a photo which then is displayed on a feed for the public as well as agencies such as city council to see. We decided to design a website as with the help of google translate and text to speech extensions, the website can be more accessible to people of different cultures and disabilities.
